IMPORTANT PLEASE READ BEFORE WATCHING THIS LECTURE:

Nimbits has release a new version of their API which has rendered part of this lecture out of date. I will update this lecture accordingly, however in the mean time please know that:

1) Posting of data requires that the data is in JSON format. Here's an example: http://www.nimbits.com/howto_api_series.jsp.

2) An Arduino library has been released to make it very easy to work with Nimbits without having to construct the HTTP body manually as I show in this lecture) (http://www.nimbits.com/howto_arduino.jsp)

Sorry about this, I will try to upload to update as soon as possible.
